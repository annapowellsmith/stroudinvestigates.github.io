<div class="standfirst">
If the Sub Rooms are sold to a private company, its owner will control all public access (including the forecourt).  Dale Vince has said he would maintain the current access and services, and there’s no reason to doubt his good intentions. But there are no details available; he could change his mind at any time; and it’s certain he won’t remain the current owner forever.

## The public want their access protected

The [available evidence](http://stroudinvestigates.co.uk/subrooms/2017/11/07/where-are-the-sub-rooms-consultations.html) shows that a majority of the public want the Sub Rooms to remain in public hands, although [the council](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/media/241244/item-8-stroud-subscriptions-rooms.pdf) and Dale Vince have stated _retaining public access_ is the most important thing.

If public ownership is not on the table, and the building and forecourt are instead sold to a private company, the council should be considering **very carefully** how they can protect the public’s access and use, as recognised [by the council themselves]([a copy of the report](http://stroudinvestigates.co.uk/data/dropin_day_feedback_report.docx)) (my emphasis):

> Only 2 [out of 126] people suggested private ownership should be considered, but still as a community arts venue ... as long as the venue remained open and offered accessible entertainment/community facilities, it was not important WHO ran it, but **SDC should protect the leasehold to prevent future sale/loss from the community**.

## Even with the best intentions, things change

As long as Ecotricity is doing well, there’s no reason to think it would stop running the Sub Rooms as a venue.  In any case, "making commercial sense" is not always Dale Vince’s priority - this is a company that loses well over two million pounds per year on Forest Green Rovers. And he has made it very clear it’s personally important to him that it continues as a venue.

However, the fortunes of business rise and fall, and once the Sub Rooms is in private hands, it is an asset that can be bought or sold like any other.

What happens if Ecotricity goes into administration? Or when Dale Vince leaves the picture?  Will the new owners feel the same way as him, or just see the Sub Rooms as an asset to be sold to the highest bidder?

There are also risks under the ownership of a benevolent owner. It’s not clear exactly how Ecotricity proposes to grant public access, and this will be subject to change.  Dale has [stated on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dale.vince/posts/515272895476034?comment_id=515845142085476&reply_comment_id=516074052062585):

> ...we’re proposing to take all costs of running the building and to maintain at least as much public use of it as it has now.

But without seeing the bid detail, it’s hard to test the assumptions behind this promise.  Running the venue _and_ using it as a staff meeting place could be a complex proposition.  For example:

* The main upstairs room will be used by up to 700 staff during the week. This presumably means some kinds of daytime events (like the [Fabulous Sound Scapes](http://www.subscriptionrooms.org.uk/whats-on/fabulous-sound-machines/) exhibition) will no longer be possible. What about sound checks and setup for bands?
* Will the traditional uses of the square (morris dancing, demos, Goodwill Evening) all be protected? How? What about if one of these clashes with a commercial event?  Could the square become a car park? Will the flower van still be allowed to use the forecourt?

## What can be done?


What are the options?  We can think of three, but are not lawyers (if you are, please [let us know](mailto:seb.bacon@gmail.com) if we’re on the right tracks!)

### 1. Covenants

The one public statement we can find from Dale Vince ([on his personal Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/dale.vince/posts/515272895476034?comment_id=515406262129364)) about legal protections is:

> We recognise the concern that one day we may choose or need to sell the Sub Rooms (though it’s totally not on our agenda) and I expect that if our bid is chosen ... we would sit down with SDC and cover issues like this with covenants. In this case it would be simple enough to require that SDC had first right to buy the building.

There are a few problems with this suggestion, and with covenants in general.

1. The council is in **a poor position to negotiate** restrictive terms _after_ accepting a bid. No restrictions were mentioned during the sale process, so any company could quite reasonably refuse to accept any new terms.  Dale Vince has indicate his willingness to be a part of such discussions, but he has no incentive to concede any control, and the Council would hold very few cards by this stage.

2. A covenant offering the Council "first right to buy the building" is **practically useless**, given the Council says it’s disposing of the building because it can’t afford to keep it.

3. This suggestion is about ownership of the building, **not access**.  A covenant to protect specific parts of the building, at specific times of day, would be unusual, complex, and hard to agree (see point 1 above).

4. A covenant is of limited use in the current political and economic context.  Its enforcement would rely on the Council having the time, money, and political will to prosecute the other party. It seems unlikely that a future council would value public access rights over the **cost of legal action** against a large company.

It is certainly _possible_ for a covenant-based approach to work, but the devil is in the details, and the details need to be thought through properly _in advance_.

### 2. Renting the building

One possibility is for the Town Council to become landlords, and **rent the space** to Ecotricity. The discussion on [this Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/dale.vince/posts/509505359386121) indicates Dale Vince doesn’t think this is a good idea.

### 3. Selling a short lease

Another possibility, which would give Ecotricity much more control, is to sell a **short-term lease** to the company. There is plenty of precedent for this.  For example, the leaseholds of schools and hospitals are commonly sold on 25 year terms under PFI contracts.  There would still be the short-term problem of ensuring public access during the lease, but medium-term the public interest could be revisited when the lease expires.

A party associated with the bid has objected (on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dale.vince/posts/515272895476034?comment_id=515517432118247&reply_comment_id=516165922053398&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R7%22%7D)) to this idea on the grounds that it "makes no commercial sense" to invest in a building you don’t own, because it wouldn’t count as an investment.

But the Ecotricity bid was made because they **need a meeting space for staff**: any investment advantages would be a tiny bonus (it would only add about 0.7 per cent to their balance sheet). As staff accommodation, a short lease could present an excellent deal.  To illustrate:

* There will be one-off costs to restore the building fabric; the [Stroud Trust bid](http://www.stroudtrust.org/plans.html) indicates the basic work might be around £150,000.
* Suppose Ecotricity paid £100,000 for a 10 year lease
* This would be equivalent to £2,000 per month over the period, for a massive office space in a prestigious building in the heart of the town.

## What you can do

**Write to your councillor** [here](https://www.writetothem.com/?a=council). Some questions you might want to include:

* How will the building, square, and public services be protected for public use in the event of a private sale?
* Do they consider convenants would be enough to protect the building and serviecs?
* If so, will any covenants be stipulated *before* committing to a preferred bidder?
* What do they think of the option of a short lease?
* Will the council publish all bids, reports on the sale, T&R minutes or notes, and the final T&R briefing document, _well before_ the next drop in event?
* Will there be a full council vote on the decision?

**Come to the "information event"** on Saturday 18 November, from 9.30am at the Sub Rooms.

**Attend the S&R Committee’s vote** on the Sub Rooms on 5th December, from 7.30pm at Stroud Council, Ebley Mill.
