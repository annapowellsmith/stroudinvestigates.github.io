<div class="standfirst">
The process of selling Stroud’s iconic Sub Rooms has been highly
secretive. Key documents have been withheld, meetings have been held in
private, and due process has not been followed.  The Council may have
breached the lawful requirement for openness and transparency in local
government decision making.
</div>

_UPDATE: since this article was published, the council published all three bids and part of the February consultation report [on their website](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/sport-leisure-parks/events-and-things-to-do/subscription-rooms/subrooms-review)._

Last Wednesday, Stroud District Council were forced
to
[announce](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-41832095) that
a secretive committee had made a decision about the Subscription
Rooms. Their recommendation: that Ecotricity should buy the Sub Rooms and the
square for £300,000.  The process has been secretive --
and possibly illegal. Read below to find out why.

Anna Powell-Smith, a local software engineer and concerned citizen, has
written [an excellent
article](https://medium.com/@annapowellsmith/three-questions-for-strouds-councillors-about-the-subscription-rooms-sell-off-b47529d3d222)
which asks three important questions about the process:

1. **Is the forecourt included in the sale of the Sub Rooms, and will it
be protected for public use?**

2. **Will the building be protected for public use?**

3. **How will the public now be consulted, and is the Council’s process
legal?**

We've had no more  information from the council or Ecotricity, so it seems
likely that the forecourt **is included**; that **no protections**
have been stipulated; and **no more consultation** is planned.

A local lawyer (who'd prefer to remain anonymous) has been digging
into the legality of the council's process. With their permission,
we've used their research to dig into Anna’s third question in more
detail.

## Who will make the decision?

The **Strategy and Resources Committee** (S&R) is in charge of finance and
asset management. Its
[13 councillors](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/meetings/members-by-committee?committee=Strategy+and+Resources+Committee) will be deciding the fate of the Sub Rooms and the main square on 5th December.

The S&R Committee will base their decision based on the secretive work
of
[8 councillors](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/subscription_rooms_decision_proc?nocache=incoming-1030022#incoming-1030022) known
as the **Task and Finish Group** (T&F).

The
**Community and Licencing Committee** has, apparently, _not_ been involved meaningfully. It is the
decision-making authority for whether a service is to be reduced,
changed or abandoned, so we think they should have been part of the process.

The **Full Council** will _not_ be involved.  Major decisions should
be made by the democratically-elected representatives of every part of
the District. This decision will not be referred to them.

With these decision-making bodies in mind, here are some further questions:

## Why have the activities of the T&F Group taken place in private?

**All** of the work so far has been done by the T&F Group, **entirely in secret**.

**No agendas, minutes or reports have been published**. The only published
documents about the Sub Rooms review are
the
[S&R report of Jan 2017](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/media/240951/item-8-stroud-subscriptions-rooms.pdf),
and
a
[list of organisations](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/sport-leisure-parks/events-and-things-to-do/subscription-rooms/subrooms-review) who
expressed an initial interest. These are the only public records of
work which has spanned over a year. Anna’s Freedom of Information
requests
have
[failed to get any new information](https://medium.com/@annapowellsmith/three-questions-for-strouds-councillors-about-the-subscription-rooms-sell-off-b47529d3d222),
except the names of the councillors in the group.

The
Council
[have told us](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/subscription_rooms_decision_proc#incoming-1050444) there
are no formal decision criteria, because this "is not a procurement
exercise". This is unfair to all parties. Even with the best of
intentions, goal posts can shift.  In the interests of fairness and
transparency, **criteria should have existed and should have been
public**, and made available before the bid process started.

Finally, it appears that T&F Group meetings are **meetings of the
Council**. They are not pre-meetings, nor informal meetings. They have
been supported by officers who have provided regular advice. The
meetings **have not been compliant with the requirements for public
access**
[in accordance with the legislation](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/schedule/12).
According
to
[at least one member of staff](http://stroudtown.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/Council-30Oct17minutes.pdf),
the internal reporting on the process has also not been adequate.

The T&F Group's recommendation was due to be published on 17 November. However,
by the end of October, their recommendation of the Ecotricity bid was common
knowledge.  This is why the decision was announced early. However, **the
report has still not been published**, and is not due to be published
until **the day before** the "information session" scheduled for 18
November.

## Was there any meaningful consultation?

In November and December 2016, the Council carried out a "pre-review
consultation", which recorded a *notable … call for an **open review**
of all options*.

Accordingly, as the [January
resolutions](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/media/241244/item-8-stroud-subscriptions-rooms.pdf)
note, *a crucial part of the review framework and community asset
transfer process is, of course, consultation and engagement with the
community and all stakeholders.*

The consultation process [as agreed by the S&R
Committee](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/media/240953/item-8-appendix-f.pdf)
included commitments to (my emphasis):

* Issue press releases to provide updates on progress and **future
opportunities** to consult
* When appropriate, hold open drop-in **sessions** at the Sub Rooms to
explain options coming forward and what they will mean, to gather
feedback for assessing the options.

There was a **single** "drop-in" event on 18 Feb. The [press release for
that
promised](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/news-archive/get-involved-open-day-on-the-sub-rooms-review-this-weekend)
a report on the SDC website, but it isn’t there. However, it turns out
that the report does exist - and luckily [we have a
copy](http://stroudinvestigates.co.uk/data/dropin_day_feedback_report.docx).

At the event, a
[handout](http://stroudinvestigates.co.uk/data/Stroud_sub_rooms_process.pdf)
was distributed which said that the following would happen in **October
2017**:

* Preparing and advertising a public consultation event on the options
* Holding a consultation event and collating feedback for the task group.

Since February, there have been three press releases regarding the sale
of the Sub Rooms: two notifications about the deadline for expressions
of interest, and a notification that the property would be advertised
for sale. **No consultation sessions** have been advertised, or happened
(to our knowledge).

It is bizarre that the T&R has recommended the winning bid **before**
gathering feedback on its report.

The second (and **final**) "drop-in" session will be on 18 November.
This is just **one day** after the T&F Group report will be published.
The event has been described by officials as being “only for information
purposes”, and is expressly **not a consultation event**.

## Was the T&F Group entitled to include the square in the sale?

The [recorded
resolution](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/media/241244/item-8-stroud-subscriptions-rooms.pdf)
of the S&R Committee in January 2017 was for the T&F Group to invite
bids for **the building**, but it has apparently included the square in
the sale, as far as we know.

## Does the Council have the right to sell the building at under its market value?

The recommendation is to sell the site to a private company for
£300,000. This is at **50% of the assessed market value**.

Current
[legislation](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/section/123)
and
[guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7690/462483.pdf)
requires local authorities to obtain best value when disposing of an
asset. Any disposal for less must get consent from the Secretary of
State, unless the disposal promotes or improves the well-being of the
community.

As all the relevant documents are hidden, it’s not possible to
understand the basis for this decision. However, the bid assessment
must be seen to be open and transparent, and there would need to be a
very clear rationale for selling the Sub Rooms and square to a
commercial organisation at less than the assessed market rate.

## Is T&F Group allowed to make a recommendation?

The S&R Committee’s [January
2017](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/media/241244/item-8-stroud-subscriptions-rooms.pdf)
minutes resolve that "any bids received and consultation feedback will
be reported back".

However, a **full recommendation** has been made: much more than a
report. And although we now know their recommendation, the actual report
will apparently be withheld for two more weeks.

## Does the Strategy and Resources Committee have the power to take the final decision?

Shouldn’t a major decision like this be made at a meeting of the full
(50-member) council, not by a small committee?

And in any case, does the S&R Committee have the power? The Sub Rooms is
a building where a public service is provided: the provision of cultural
and community activities. The Committee is only allowed to consider
finance and asset management. They have **no remit or power to recommend
the reduction or alteration of a service**; this is the responsibility
of the Communities Committee.

Yet the Communities Committee have never received a written report on
this matter. They’ve not discussed it, and they’ve not delegated their
responsibility to the Task and Finish Group.  Instead, the Sub Rooms
have been considered solely as an asset.

## Our position

We believe that the Council has undertaken a process in which they have
**ignored** the legal requirement for public access, **ignored**
constitutional delegations, **ignored** committee delegations, and
**failed to consult appropriately** on a significant change to a public
service in **contravention of their own decisions**.

There appears to have been **no constitutional decision to review the
service** or alter the provision provided at the Sub Rooms. There has
been **no decision** to include the forecourt in the disposal, yet it
appears to be part of the sale. We think the process **breaches the
lawful requirement** for openness and transparency in local government
decision-making, let alone accepted good practice.

There appears to be **no lawful justification for selling the
building** at less than best value, to an organisation whose bid will
involve a **reduction in public access**.

We are all hampered by the lack of information, and instead have been
told just to "wait and see".

## What you can do

**Write to your councillor** [here](https://www.writetothem.com/?a=council). Some questions you might want to include:

* Has the decision making process been lawful?
* Will the council publish all bids, reports on the sale, T&R minutes or notes, and the final T&R briefing document, _well before_ the next drop in event?
* How will the building, square, and public services be protected for public use in the event of a private sale?
* Why won't there be a full council vote on the decision?


**Come to the "information event"** on Saturday 18 November, from 9.30am at the Sub Rooms.

**Attend the S&R Committee's vote** on the Sub Rooms on 5th December, from 7.30pm at Stroud Council, Ebley Mill.
