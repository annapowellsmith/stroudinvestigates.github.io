<div class="standfirst">
The process of selling Stroud’s iconic Sub Rooms has been highly secretive. Key documents have been withheld, meetings have been held in private, and due process has not been followed.  The Council may have breached the lawful requirement for openness and transparency in local government decision making.
</div>

On Wednesday, Stroud District Council were forced to [announce](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-41832095) that a secretive committee had made a decision about the Subscription Rooms: to recommend that local company Ecotricity can buy the Sub Rooms, and (we think) the square in front of it, for £300,000.  The process has been secretive and possibly illegal. Read below to find out why.

I think the [bid](http://www.stroudtrust.org/plans.html) from the new [Stroud Trust](http://www.stroudtrust.org/) sounds really exciting, and should be discussed by the community in depth (see <a href="http://www.stroudtrust.org/faq.html">this FAQ</a> for starters).  In addition, I think Ecotricity has brought a lot to the district, and I can imagine a great outcome where Ecotricity plays a central role as a partner with the Trust. However, given that we’re talking about the **permanent disposal** of a **public asset** (and service) to a **private company**, I have big concerns about "bizarre secrecy" of the Council, referred to by [the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-41832095). If this is a model for the future sell-off of our other assets, we should all be concerned.

Anna Powell-Smith, a local software engineer and concerned citizen, has written [an excellent article](https://medium.com/@annapowellsmith/three-questions-for-strouds-councillors-about-the-subscription-rooms-sell-off-b47529d3d222) which asks three big questions about the sale process:

1. **Is the forecourt included in the sale of the Sub Rooms, and will it be protected for public use?**

2. **Will the building be protected for public use?**

3. **How will the public now be consulted, and is the Council’s process legal?**

In the absence of any clarifications from the council or the preferred bidder, it seems likely that the forecourt **is included**; that **no protections** have been stipulated; and **no real consultation** is planned.

Today,  with generous input from a local lawyer, I’d like to dig into Anna’s third question in more detail.

## About the bids

Anna outlined the two bids in her article. One bid is by a new community group called the [Stroud Trust](http://www.stroudtrust.org/). Their bid has been [published in full](http://stroudtown.gov.uk/2017/10/30/subscription-rooms-bid/).

We don’t know a lot about Ecotricity’s bid, because it hasn’t been published. Almost everything we know about it is from articles in the local press (e.g. [here](http://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/who-take-iconic-venue-rival-640092) and [here](http://www.stroudnewsandjournal.co.uk/news/15588141.Ecotricity_founder_Dale_Vince_reveals_details_of_bid_to_buy_Stroud_s_iconic_Sub_Rooms/)), and on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dale.vince/posts/509505359386121). There’s one additional nugget which has been leaked: the offer is to pay £300,000 for the freehold.

It would be great if Ecotricity could publish their bid, so we could all form our own opinions of the merits of both bids. Relying on rumour and media reports makes it really hard.

[Apparently](http://stroudtown.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/Council-30Oct17minutes.pdf) there is also a third bid, about which literally nothing is known: an internal bid from the Council. This should be published, obviously.

## All about Committees

Before I get on to my questions about the process, some definitions. The Council is stuffed with dull-sounding committees and procedures, so it’s worth trying to pin these down in your head before continuing.

**Strategy and Resources Committee (S&R)**: a committee of Stroud District Council. Its [13 members](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/meetings/members-by-committee?committee=Strategy+and+Resources+Committee) have responsibility for finance and asset management. They will be deciding the fate of the Sub Rooms and the main squareon 5 December, but I’m not sure they have the authority to do this.

**Task and Finish Group (T&F):** a group of 8 councillors (but I can’t find out who they are), delegated by the Strategy and Resources Committee last year to undertake a review of the financial sustainability of the Sub Rooms, and this year to conduct a bid process. They’ve done it in private; they included the sale of the square in front of the Sub Rooms, and have possibly exceeded their remit by making a recommendation. They were also tasked with carrying out a public consultation, which has been minimal to say the least.

**Community and Licencing Committee**: a committee of Stroud District Council, with responsibility for cultural services and public spaces. It’s the decision-making authority for whether a service is to be reduced, changed or abandoned. It’s not been involved in the process, but I argue below that it should have been.

With that in mind, here are some questions to complement Anna’s:

## Why have the activities of the T&F Group taken place in private?

**All** of the work so far has been done by the T&F Group, **entirely in secret**.

No agendas, minutes or reports have been published. The only published documents about the Sub Rooms review are the [S&R report of Jan 2017](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/media/240951/item-8-stroud-subscriptions-rooms.pdf), and a [list of organisations](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/sport-leisure-parks/events-and-things-to-do/subscription-rooms/subrooms-review) who expressed an initial interest. These are the only public records of work which has spanned over a year. Anna’s Freedom of Information requests have [failed to get any further information](https://medium.com/@annapowellsmith/three-questions-for-strouds-councillors-about-the-subscription-rooms-sell-off-b47529d3d222).

T&F Group meetings are meetings of the Council. They are not pre-meetings, nor informal meetings. They have been supported by officers who have provided regular advice. The meetings have not been compliant with the requirements for public access [in accordance with the legislation](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/schedule/12).  According to [at least one member of staff](http://stroudtown.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/Council-30Oct17minutes.pdf), the internal reporting on the process has also not been adequate.

Their recommendation was due to be published on 17 November. However, due to leaks, their decision to recommend the Ecotricity bid was common knowledge, and this was officially announced early. However, **the report has still not been published**, and is not due to be published until **the day before** the "information session" scheduled for 18 November.

## Was there any meaningful consultation?

In November and December 2016, the Council carried out a "pre-review consultation", which recorded a *notable … call for an **open review** of all options*. It [found](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/media/240955/item-8-appendix-d.pdf):

> responses were enormously positive and passionate about the venue and service. However, there was an unexpected amount of support for keeping the venue not just public, but within SDC control


Accordingly, as the [January resolutions](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/media/241244/item-8-stroud-subscriptions-rooms.pdf) note, *a crucial part of the review framework and community asset transfer process is, of course, consultation and engagement with the community and all stakeholders.*

The consultation process [as agreed by the S&R Committee](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/media/240953/item-8-appendix-f.pdf) included commitments to:

* Issue press releases to provide updates on progress and future opportunities to consult
* When appropriate, hold open drop-in sessions at the Sub Rooms to explain options coming forward and what they will mean, to gather feedback for assessing the options.

There was a **single** "drop-in" event on 18 Feb. The [press release for that promised](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/news-archive/get-involved-open-day-on-the-sub-rooms-review-this-weekend) a report on the SDC website, but it isn’t there. However, it turns out that the report does exist - and luckily [we have a copy](http://stroudinvestigates.co.uk/data/dropin_day_feedback_report.docx).

At the event, a [handout](http://stroudinvestigates.co.uk/data/Stroud_sub_rooms_process.pdf) was distributed which said that the following would happen in **October 2017**:

* Preparing and advertising a public consultation event on the options
* Holding a consultation event and collating feedback for the task group.

Since February, there have been three press releases regarding the sale of the Sub Rooms: two notifications about the deadline for expressions of interest, and a notification that the property would be advertised for sale. **No consultation sessions** have been advertised, or happened (to our knowledge).

It is bizarre that the T&R has recommended the winning bid **before** gathering feedback on its report.

The second (and **final**) "drop-in" session will be on 18 November. This is just **one day** after the T&F Group report will be published. The event has been described by officials as being “only for information purposes”, and is expressly **not a consultation event**.

## Was the T&F Group entitled to include the square in the sale?

The [recorded resolution](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/media/241244/item-8-stroud-subscriptions-rooms.pdf) of the S&R Committee in January 2017 was for the T&F Group to invite bids for **the building**, but it has apparently included the square in the sale, as far as we know.

## Does the T&F Group have a mandate to provide a recommendation?

The S&R Committee’s [January 2017](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/media/241244/item-8-stroud-subscriptions-rooms.pdf) minutes resolve that "any bids received and consultation feedback will be reported back".

However, a **full recommendation** has been made: much more than a report. And although we now know their recommendation, the actual report is apparently being withheld for two more weeks.

Does the Council have the right to sell the building at under its market value?

The recommendation is to sell the site to a private company for £300,000. This is at **50% of the assessed market value**.

Current [legislation](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/section/123) and [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7690/462483.pdf) requires local authorities to obtain best value when disposing of an asset. Any disposal for less must get consent from the Secretary of State, unless the disposal promotes or improves the well-being of the community.

As all documents are presently withheld from public scrutiny, it’s not possible to understand the basis for this decision. However, the bid assessment must be seen to be open and transparent, and there would need to be a very clear rationale for the disposal to a commercial organisation at less than the assessed market rate.

## Does the Strategy and Resources Committee have the power to make this decision?

Shouldn’t a major decision like this be made at a meeting of the full (50-member) council, not by a small committee?

And in any case, does the S&R Committee have the power? The Sub Rooms is a building where a public service is provided: the provision of cultural and community activities. The Committee is only allowed to consider finance and asset management. They have **no remit or power to recommend the reduction or alteration of a service**; this is the responsibility of the Communities Committee. Yet the Communities Committee have never received a written report on this matter. They’ve not discussed it, and they’ve not delegated their responsibility to the Task and Finish Group. Instead, the Sub Rooms have been considered solely as an asset.

## Conclusion

We believe that the Council has undertaken a process in which they have **ignored** the legal requirement for public access, **ignored** constitutional delegations, **ignored** committee delegations, and **failed to consult appropriately** on a significant change to a public service in **contravention of their own decisions**.

There appears to have been **no constitutional decision to review the service** or alter the provision provided at the Sub Rooms. There has been **no decision** to include the forecourt in the disposal, yet it appears to be part of the sale. We think the process **breaches the lawful requirement** for openness and transparency in local government decision-making, let alone accepted good practice.

There appears to be **no lawful justification for selling the building** at less than best value, to a commercial organisation which has made it clear that its bid will involve a **reduction in public access**.

We are all hampered by the lack of information, and instead have been told just to "wait and see".

In order to better assess the sitation, and be fully consulted and informed on all the options, the public need to see:

* The Ecotricity bid
* The internal Council bid
* The T&F report, *well before* the next "information session"
* The publication of any notes or minutes taken at T&F Group meetings
